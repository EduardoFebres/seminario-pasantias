Lo primero que pienso de esto es cómo se invierten los roles. Digamos, desde Miranda hasta Rodríguez, la narrativa del alter-americanismo es la de una invasión positiva que se opone a una invasión negativa (la invasión española, que se combate con una invasión militar, primero; la invasión de "comercios, colonias y cultos", que se combate con una invasión demográfica, después); a partir de Martí, el alter-americanismo es meramente defensivo, se define por oposición al americanismo del norte. Digamos que la estructura conspirativa se desbalancea.

I like this perspective of fantasies of the other as a product generated by conspiracy theories, and not as part of the conspiracy theories themself
