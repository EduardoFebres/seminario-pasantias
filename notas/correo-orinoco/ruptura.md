### Del Castillo, Lina. “Inventing Columbia/Colombia”. _The First Wave of Decolonization

El episodio de la prisión de Miranda, de donde viene la leyenda del "bochinche", es donde se puede decir que el colombismo sufre su primera mutación.


Importante la sincronía en 1815 entre el proyecto constitucional-utópico de Thornton y la versión terrenal de Colombia, que Bolívar formula por primera vez en la Carta de Jamaica (50-51)


> As Miranda lay disgraced and dying in a Cadiz prison, some of his  
> acquaintances in the United States, including William Thornton, archi-  
> tect of Washington’s Capitol building, put forward a remarkable plan  
> modeled on Miranda’s vision. The idea was to create a federated republic  
> uniting North and South Columbia, with Panama as its capital. Not ev-  
> eryone was on board with this plan. Bolívar decided to make Miranda’s  
> Colombian project his own, tweaking it for what he understood to be  
> on-the-ground realities.

> Thornton explained to his readers in 1815 how he had shared an ear-  
> lier draft with a person ‘in whom the worthy patriots of Caracas since  
> confided.’ The statement is a clear allusion to Miranda, but Miranda  
> was not the only person with ties to Spanish America with whom Thorn-  
> ton shared the document. Late in 1810, as Miranda sailed once again  
> for Venezuela with Simón Bolívar, Thornton had established contact  
> with young Spanish Americans from Caracas, including Simón Bolívar’s  
> brother, Juan Vicente Bolívar, and his companion, Telésforo de Orea. The  
> two men were received by James Monroe, and according to reports, they  
> held several meetings with Thornton.
