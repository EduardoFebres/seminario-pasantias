### Del Castillo, Lina. “Inventing Columbia/Colombia”. 

> After arriving on the Leander to the newly independent  
> nation that abolished slavery, Miranda hoisted the new tricolor Colom-  
> bian flag, thereby making clear his intention to liberate all Spanish Amer-  
> ica. **Haitian presses agreed to print 2,000 copies of five different texts**,  
> each promising **to recover ‘our glory as Colombian Americans.’ Miranda**  
> **then held a swearing-in ceremony in Jacmel, Haiti, which required all volunteers to take an oath of loyalty to ‘the army of Colombia.’ The**  
> **volunteers swore**  
> **to be true and faithful to the free people of South America, indepen-**  
> **dent of Spain and to serve them honestly and faithfully against all**  
> **their enemies or opposers** whatsoever and to observe and obey the  
> orders of the supreme government of that country legally appointed,  
> and the orders of the General and his officers sent by them. 56  
> **Many of these recruits were US citizens. Miranda, however, was not ask-**  
> **ing them to renounce their American citizenship. On the contrary, the**  
> **oath they took included a clause clarifying that their actions on behalf of**  
> **Colombia were evidence of American allegiance**. 57

> After raising the Colombian flag at La Vela de Coro, Miranda distrib-  
> uted handkerchiefs with portraits of Popham, who was on his way to  
> liberate Buenos Aires. Other handkerchiefs boasted images of George  
> Washington and of Miranda himself. Christopher Columbus made it  
> onto flags with British colors, signaling ties to the British who helped  
> sponsor liberation. 58 These Anglophile images together with the piles of  
> printed broadsides and declarations Miranda produced for this Colom-  
> bian enterprise made explicit the transatlantic and hemispheric roots of  
> the endeavor.

> From June 1783 until December 1784, Miranda encountered the conti-
> nental, republican ‘Columbia’ conjured by historians, poets, and schol-
> ars. The people he met included Phyllis Wheatly, the African-American
> poet who had allegorized the United States as ‘Columbia’ in 1776. 28 Mi-
> randa also met with the leaders of Yale, Brown, Harvard, Dartmouth, and
> Kings College, the last of which had been renamed Columbia by stipula-
> tion of the New York State Legislature on May 1, 1784. 29
